# Placement-Portal

A web portal for easing the placement activities in the college and generating different statistics.

The students can log in to the portal to add the preferences for the organisations visiting the campus (if they are eligible) and they can see different kinds of statistics related to the ongoing placement activities happening in the college.

The organisations can sign up for the portal using their basic information and the information regarding the profiles and CTCs they are offering along with the eligibility criteria. 
They can also see the college placement insights along with the insights of various skills and academic performance of students.
